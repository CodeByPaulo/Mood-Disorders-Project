# Scenario
You are working as a data scientist for a renowned mood-changing center named Bright-Hope. Based on available data from previous patients, your manager has asked you to prepare a thorough report that outlines your findings.

# Problem Statement
Medical professionals work hard to improve patients’ lives. The advancement of statistical analysis and machine learning and applying these concepts in the medical field has allowed medical staff to leverage the expertise of data scientists to predict the onsets of diseases and medical emergencies and classify diagnoses.

# Objective 
Build several prediction models to identify patients who suffer from mood disorders. The goal is to improve patients' lives.

# Data
Mood Disorder Dataset. The dataset consists of many features and the target class (Diagnosis).
