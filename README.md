# Scenario
You are working as a data scientist for a renowned mood-changing center named Bright-Hope. You have been charged with identifying patients who have mood disorders. Based on available data from previous patients, your manager has asked you to prepare a thorough report that outlines your findings along with a 3-minute presentation for the CEO. Good luck!

# Problem Statement
Medical professionals work hard to improve patients’ lives. The advancement of statistical analysis and machine learning and applying these concepts in the medical field, has allowed medical staff to leverage the expertise of data scientists to predict the onsets of diseases and medical emergencies, and classify diagnosis, to just name a few.

You will build several prediction models to identify patients who suffer from mood disorders, using the expertise gained in this course: importing libraries, loading data into data frames, manipulating and wrangling data, exploring and visualizing data, writing functions, feature engineering, developing models, and finally evaluating and comparing models. The goal is to improve patients' lives.

# Data
You will be using the Mood Disorder Dataset Download Mood Disorder Datasetavailable through canvas. The dataset consists of many features and the target class (Diagnosis). As part of your exploratory data analysis, you need do is explain the features and list the unique values in each feature.

# Part 1 – Prediction models Report
This part is a group effort. The groups are assigned randomly unless you have emailed the professor about your team preference.

1. In this part, you will create a Jupyter Notebook using the dataset described above, which is available from Canvas. You will be doing these steps:
  * Import Libraries
  * Load dataset
  * Exploratory Data Analysis
    * Remove identifiable features to preserve privacy.
    * Data Dimension
    * Data Types
    * Summary Statistics
    * Correlation plots
    * Data Distribution (plot features against Target variable)
* Data Pre-Processing and Wrangling
    * Missing Values
    * Missing values imputation (if needed)
    * Duplicate Data
    * Feature Engineering
    * Outliers
    * Categorical Data Encoding
    * Feature Scaling
    * Build functions.
* Models Building:
    * K-Nearest Neighbors
    * Decision Tree
    * Random Forest
    * Extra Tree Classifier
* Models Evaluation and Comparisons
    * K-Fold Cross Validation
    * Confusion Matrix
    * Accuracy
    * Precision
    * Recall or Sensitivity
    * Specificity
    * F1-score
2. Part 1 Deliverable is a PDF version of your Notebook submitted once to the group project drop box. In Jupyter Lab, File -> Save and Export Notebook AS -> PDF. If you get an error saving as PDF, save it as HTML, then open HTML file and right click and print to PDF.
 
# Part 2 – Presentation
After finishing the report, each student will need to summarize the report in a 3-minute presentation. This is an individual effort not a group effort. The presentation should be prepared and articulated at a level suitable for a senior business executive, such as a CEO or the Chief Medical Executive -- there is no need to show code but, rather, the focus should be on the problem, the analysis and results uncovered, and the recommendations to solve and minimize the bad outcome. The presentation should address the items in the grading rubric, be succinct, and to the point. For the presentation, record a 3 min presentation (Voice over slides) and upload it to a separate submission location created as an assignment named "Final Project Presentation Submission".

For the presentation, I suggest using PowerPoint as it is a familiar product that is available to students and professors through UC. You are welcome to use any tool if the final outcome is a standard format that is easily watched. If the presentation can’t be run or viewed or watched, it will receive 0 points, so make sure you deliver a presentation that is valid.

The presentation must be done individually and separately by each group member based on the report. There is no collaboration when creating the presentation. Each person will work on his/her own. The findings will be similar since they are based on the same report, but how you present is what sets you apart from your colleagues. The purpose is to showcase your individual creativity and ability leveraging findings. Any students submitting similar presentations will receive a Zero on both the report and the presentation and will be reported as committing plagiarism.
